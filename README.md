# RememberMe

Problem:
I often struggle to remember the names of people I’ve just met, especially when some of them remember mine. I’ve found that this is a common issue, Recalling names can be challenging when we frequently encounter new individuals.

Solution:
I created the RememberMe App, which helps users store and recall names and unique details about each person, facilitating stronger connections.
